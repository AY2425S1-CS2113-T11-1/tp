# Developer Guide

## Acknowledgements

- This project was inspired by [AddressBook-Level3 (AB3)](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3), and several code structures were adapted for the MediTask application.
- JSON serialization and deserialization functionality uses the [Jackson library](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson).
- Logging setup was referenced from open-source Java projects using `Logger`.

## Implementation

### **AddPatientCommand**

#### Implementation

The add patient feature allows users to add a new patient to the hospital system. This is facilitated by the `AddPatientCommand`, which handles the logic of adding a patient and updating the systemâ€™s state and storage.

1. **User Input**: The user enters the `addPatient` command followed by patient details (e.g., name).
2. **Command Parsing**: The `Parser` parses the input and creates an `AddPatientCommand` object.
3. **Execution**: The `AddPatientCommand` checks if the patient already exists in the `Hospital`. If not, it adds the patient.
4. **Storage Update**: The updated hospital data, now containing the new patient, is saved to storage.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `AddPatientCommand` is executed:

- **If Condition**: The command checks if the patient already exists before adding the patient.
- **Logging**: If a duplicate is detected, an error is logged.
