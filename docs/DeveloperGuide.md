# Developer Guide

## Acknowledgements

- This project was inspired by [AddressBook-Level3 (AB3)](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3), and several code structures were adapted for the MediTask application.
- JSON serialization and deserialization functionality uses the [Jackson library](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson).
- Logging setup was referenced from open-source Java projects using `Logger`.

## Design
### Parser
The Parser interface uses a series of classes to implement the various commands.
![Parser_Class_Diagram](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-1/tp/raw/master/docs/images/ParserClass.png)


### **AddPatientCommand**
#### Implementation

The add patient feature allows users to add a new patient to the hospital system. This is facilitated by the `AddPatientCommand`, which handles the logic of adding a patient and updating the system’s state and storage.

1. **User Input**: The user enters the `addPatient` command followed by patient details (e.g., name).
2. **Command Parsing**: The `Parser` parses the input and creates an `AddPatientCommand` object.
3. **Execution**: The `AddPatientCommand` checks if the patient already exists in the `Hospital`. If not, it adds the patient.
4. **Storage Update**: The updated hospital data, now containing the new patient, is saved to storage.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `AddPatientCommand` is executed:

![AddPatientCommand Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-1/tp/raw/master/docs/images/AddPatientSequenceDiagram.png)

- **If Condition**: The command checks if the patient already exists before adding the patient.
- **Logging**: If a duplicate is detected, an error is logged.

### **AddTaskCommand**
#### Implementation

The add Task feature allows users to add different types of task to a patient's records. This is facilitated by the `AddTaskCommand`, which handles the logic of adding a task and updating the system’s state and storage.
There are three possible types of tasks - Todo, Deadline and Repeat.

1. **User Input**:
* **Todo**: The user enters the `todo` command followed by tag details (e.g., /tag).
* **Deadline**: The user enters the `deadline` command followed by the deadline (e.g., /by) and tag details (e.g., /tag).
* * **Repeat**: The user enters the `repeat` command followed by the recurring basis (e.g., /every) and tag details (e.g., /tag).
2. **Command Parsing**: 
* **Todo Task**: The `Parser` parses the input and creates an `AddTodoParser` object.
* **Deadline Task**: The `Parser` parses the input and creates an `AddDeadlineParser` object.
* **Repeat Task**: The `Parser` parses the input and creates an `AddRepeatParser` object.
3. **Execution**: The `AddTaskCommand` adds the task.
4. **Storage Update**: The updated patient's data, now containing the new task, is saved to storage.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `AddTaskCommand` is executed:

### **FindCommand**
#### Implementation

The find feature allows users to find the name of a patient, or the name of a task. This is facilitated by the `FindPatientCommand` and `FindTaskCommand`.

1. **User Input**: The user enters the `find` command followed by keywords
2. **Command Parsing**: The `Parser` parses the input and creates a `FindParser` object.
3. **Execution**: The `FindPatientCommand` or `FindTaskCommand` searches for the task.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `FindPatientCommand` is executed:

### **State Switching Feature**
#### Implementation

The state switching feature allows the system to change its mode of operation between `MAIN_STATE` (for patient management) and `TASK_STATE` (for task management). This allows the software to handle commands differently based on the current state.

1. **User Input**: The user enters a command pertaining either to patients (in `MAIN_STATE`) or tasks (in `TASK_STATE`).
2. **Command Parsing**: The `Parser` checks the current state of the software by interacting with the `State` class. Depending on the state, it interprets  the command differently.
3. **State Checking**: The `State` class tracks the current state of the application. If the system is in `MAIN_STATE`, the `Parser` creates patient-related commands (e.g., `AddPatientCommand`). If it's in `TASK_STATE`, task-related commands (e.g., `AddTaskCommand`)
4. **Command Execution**: The appropriate command is then executed. For example, in `MAIN_STATE`, it adds a new patient, while in `TASK_STATE`, it adds a new task to a patient's task list.
5. **State Transitions**: Commands like `SelectPatientCommand` and `BackCommand`, trigger state transitions.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the state-switching mechanism works:

![State-Switching Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-1/tp/raw/master/docs/images/StateSwitchingSequenceDiagram.png)

- **State Checking**: When user inputs a command, the `Parser` queries the `State` object to check whether the system is in `MAIN_STATE` or `TASK_STATE`.
- **State Transitions**: When a `SelectPatientCommand` is executed, the system transitions from `MAIN_STATE` to `TASK_STATE`. Vice versa for `BackCommand`.
- **Command Execution**: Commands are executed based on the current state. For example, in `MAIN_STATE`, patient-related commands are processed, while in `TASK_STATE`, task-related commands are handled.
